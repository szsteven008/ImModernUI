Modern shadcn-inspired UI components for Dear ImGui

ImModernUI is a component library that brings a clean, modern design system inspired by shadcn to Dear ImGui, while preserving the simplicity and performance of the immediate-mode paradigm.

It helps you build professional-looking tools and internal applications with consistent visuals and composable primitives.
